      <h2>This isn't your average salad book! This is not a bland collection of recipes!!</h2>
      <p>To begin with, it's for anyone who always thought they couldn't put together a nourishing and quick snack/light meal or didn't enjoy cooking, leave alone making a healthy plate of good carbohydrates, proteins, fiber and fat!</p>
      <p><strong>Hi!!! I am a mom to two growing up kids, a long-distance runner, a fitness trainer and an educator. I am NOT a chef or a food blogger!</strong> I eat to <em>fuel</em> myself and my family.</p>
      <p>Recently, I gave myself a 30-day challenge to come up with the most uncomplicated, unprocessed, seasonal, nourishing, and quick salads that can be done under 20–25 mins! It has now resulted in a collection of flavor-packed recipes that are anything but boring.</p>

      <h3>Inside this book, you’ll find:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>30 easy salad recipes</strong> using ingredients you likely already have, especially if you have kids or/and have busy work days.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time reflections</strong> from my daily journey: the wins, the flops, the lessons. It's conversational, as if we are sitting across a table!</li>
        <li><strong>Candid kids' reviews</strong> on each salad: because children are the most unfiltered food critics you’ll ever meet. My kids are for sure!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>I Had A Few Guiding Principles While Making These Salads:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If it took more than 20–25 minutes, I was overcomplicating it.</li>
        <li>No store-bought/over processed sauces, just my own taste buds and a few trusty ingredients.</li>
        <li>Every day, something had to be new: a flavor, an ingredient, or the way I sliced the cucumbers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The Best Part</strong>? These salads can be taken both as snacks and light meals. They can be paired with all vegetarian and non-vegetarian proteins.</p>

      <h3>I Never Meant To Write A Cookbook</h3>
      <p>As the days passed and the salads piled up, I realized this could be a brilliant go-to resource for parents, students, busy working executives or anyone who wants to eat more mindfully without making it a production. This is for anyone who’s ever said, “I’m not really a cook” and is looking for a way to feel more alive in their own kitchen and connected to making something meaningful for themselves.</p>

      <h3>I Wrote My Everyday Thoughts, Salads and Kids' Feedback - Everyday for 30 days</h3>
      <p>It has my reflections on motherhood, being a woman in this ever changing world, movies, everyday humor (yes, even <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>) and the witty feedback my kids gave on my salads everyday! I put my love for writing in this cookbook. One more reason for you to give this book a shot!</p>

      <h3>Lastly, it's a meaningful gift for:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your kid heading off to college</li>
        <li>Your friend who wants to bring in merry in the everyday mundane cooking</li>
        <li>For your loved ones you want to inspire towards uncomplicated and mindful eating</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What To Expect On This Journey</h3>
      <p>If you're joining me on this journey, whether you follow all 30 days or just drop in now and then, know this: Every day will be a work in progress. Some days your reason to make a salad will be fueled by a random veggie/ fruit, some days it will be your kids’ reluctant approval. Whatever your reason, keep it fun. Keep it real.</p>
