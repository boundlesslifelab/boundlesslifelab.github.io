            <p>Most people set goals. Few stick to them. Not because they're lazy or need more motivation. But because they never get clear on what actually matters. And even when they do, they don't have a plan or system to stay consistent when life gets messy.</p>
            
            <p>This workshop is built to fix exactly that.</p>
            
            <p>It's a no-fluff, working session where you'll cut through the noise, set one clear, meaningful goal, and turn it into a plan you can actually follow.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
            
            <h3>How to set goals that matter.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stop chasing random stuff that doesn't matter.</li>
                <li>We'll help you figure out what actually deserves your attention — across life, work, health, and whatever else is on your plate. Then cut the rest. Ruthlessly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Turn That Goal Into a Plan</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We'll break yours down into simple, doable milestones.</li>
                <li>Not by mapping out every step of the next six months — but by setting the first few milestones you can aim for, then deciding what matters most this month and this week.</li>
                <li>You'll learn how to stay flexible, adjust as you go, and keep moving without overplanning yourself into a corner.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to build habits that stick.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Forget motivation. It's unreliable as hell.</li>
                <li>No hype, no hacks. Just small, smart systems that make it easier to show up, even when you don't feel like it.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to stay on track when plans fall apart.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Because they will. Plans fall apart. Motivation dies.</li>
                <li>You'll leave with a simple review system to check progress, adjust fast, and keep moving forward without the drama.</li>
                <li><strong>Progress over perfection. Always.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>No fluff. No life-coach speak. Just what works.</strong></p>
            </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Who's It For?</h2>
            
            <p>Anyone tired of saying "this year will be different" and then falling into the same old loop.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're aiming for a career breakthrough, rebuilding your fitness, fixing your finances, or focusing on personal growth — this workshop helps you lock in what matters and start moving fast.</p>
            
            <p>It's for people who are ready to stop overthinking and start doing.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> Set the right goal - Align your priorities across life pillars — because your life isn't lived in silos</li>
                                <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> Turn goals into clear actionable plans - Break priorities into SMART, clear, no-bullshit goals with practical milestones</li>
                                <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> Stay on track - Build a simple system of regular check-ins and reviews that keeps you sharp and accountable</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-question">How Does This Actually Work?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>We get it — change is hard, and behavior change is the hardest kind. Most people rely on motivation, but motivation is unreliable. It fades when life gets messy, stress kicks in, or you just don't feel like it.</p>
                            <p>That's why this isn't a motivational talk. It's a doing workshop.</p>
                            <p>Big goals need small wins. Small wins need habits.</p>
                            <p>We do this by:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Breaking big, intimidating goals into small, achievable milestones and immediate actions.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Focusing on regular wins and frequent reviews.</strong> Failure isn't a flaw — it's expected. What matters is how fast you adjust, not how perfectly you execute.</li>
                                <li><strong>"Building habits by tying new actions to things you already do, so they happen on autopilot."</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Leaning on systems, not willpower.</strong> You'll design a simple, flexible system you can rely on when your mood, schedule, or motivation turns on you.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>In short: we turn "I should" into "I did" — one doable step at a time.</strong></p>

                        <div class="faq-question">Is this a one-time thing or a series?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">One sharp, high-impact session. You'll walk out with a system, not a sales pitch for a follow-up course.</div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="faq-question">What if I already have goals?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Good. We'll see if they still matter, if they're clear, and if you've got a way to follow through when motivation takes a nap. The workshop will help you refine them using our frameworks.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Only if you want to. No forced sharing. No oversharing. Total choice.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Just come with an open mind and, if possible, some goals you've been thinking about. We'll provide all templates and materials needed during the session.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Nope. Doesn't matter if you're leading a team, launching a business, training for a race, or just tired of drifting. This is for anyone ready to move with purpose.</div>

                            <p>We've faced the same distractions, doubts, and curveballs you do. This workshop is built on what worked for us — and what still works when motivation inevitably dies.</p>

                        <div class="faq-question">Why are you doing this?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Because we know how hard it is to chase big goals when motivation keeps letting you down. We've seen people — ourselves included — spend years stuck in cycles of overplanning, waiting for the "right time," or relying on bursts of willpower that fade fast.</p>
                            <p><strong>We're convinced this works.</strong> We've tested these systems in real life — through Ironman races, marathon seasons, career pivots, competitive exams, raising kids, and building businesses. And we've seen how breaking big goals into small, winnable actions and backing them with habits can transform how people show up in every part of life.</p>
                            <p><strong>We're doing this because it's our shared obsession.</strong> We've bonded over this exact passion: helping people stop drifting and start doing. This workshop is how we pass that on.</p>

                        <div class="faq-question">Will I get support after the workshop?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">The workshop is designed to give you a complete system you can implement independently. However, we'll provide resources you can reference afterward to help reinforce what you've learned.</div>

                        <div class="faq-question">How is this different from other goal-setting workshops?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We focus on execution, not just inspiration. Many workshops leave you feeling good but without clear next steps. We prioritize practical applications, real-world examples, and creating systems that work even when willpower doesn't.</div>
