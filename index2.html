            <p>Most people set goals. Few stick to them.</p>
            <p>Not because they're lazy or need more motivation. But because they never get clear on what actually matters. And even when they do, they don't have a plan or system to stay consistent when life gets messy.</p>
            <p><strong>This workshop is built to fix exactly that.</strong></p>
            <p>It's a no-fluff, working session where you'll cut through the noise, set one clear, meaningful goal, and turn it into a plan you can actually follow.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>How to set goals that matter</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stop chasing random stuff that doesn't matter</li>
                        <li>Figure out what actually deserves your attention — across life, work, health, and whatever else is on your plate</li>
                        <li>Cut the rest. Ruthlessly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Turn That Goal Into a Plan</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Break your goals down into simple, doable milestones</li>
                        <li>Set the first few milestones you can aim for, then decide what matters most this month and this week</li>
                        <li>Stay flexible, adjust as you go, and keep moving without overplanning yourself into a corner</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Forget motivation. It's unreliable as hell.</li>
                        <li>No hype, no hacks. Just small, smart systems that make it easier to show up, even when you don't feel like it</li>

                    <h3>How to stay on track when plans fall apart</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because they will. Plans fall apart. Motivation dies.</li>
                        <li>Leave with a simple review system to check progress, adjust fast, and keep moving forward without the drama</li>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Just come with an open mind and, if possible, some goals you've been thinking about. We'll provide all templates and materials needed during the session.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Nope. Doesn't matter if you're leading a team, launching a business, training for an Ironman, or just tired of drifting. This is for anyone ready to move with purpose.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Who are you, and why are you the right people for this?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">We've lived this. Not just talked about it. We've built careers, businesses, bodies, and lives by getting clear, setting sharp goals, and sticking to systems when the motivation wore off. This is the stuff we use ourselves, and we're passing it on raw and real.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Will I get support after the workshop?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The workshop is designed to give you a complete system you can implement independently. However, we'll provide resources you can reference afterward to help reinforce what you've learned.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How is this different from other goal-setting workshops?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">We focus on execution, not just inspiration. Many workshops leave you feeling good but without clear next steps. We prioritize practical applications, real-world examples, and creating systems that work even when willpower doesn't.</div>
