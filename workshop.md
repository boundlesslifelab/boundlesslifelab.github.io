## **Goal Pursuit Workshop**

### **Stop Drifting. Start Doing.**

Most people set goals. Few stick to them.
Not because they’re lazy or need more motivation. But because they never get clear on what actually matters. And even when they do, they don’t have a plan or system to stay consistent when life gets messy.

This workshop is built to fix exactly that.

It’s a no-fluff, working session where you’ll cut through the noise, set one clear, meaningful goal, and turn it into a plan you can actually follow.



### **What You’ll Learn**

- **How to set goals that matter.** 
  - Stop chasing random stuff that doesn’t matter.
  - We’ll help you figure out what actually deserves your attention — across life, work, health, and whatever else is on your plate. Then cut the rest. Ruthlessly.
- **Turn That Goal Into a Plan** 
  -  We’ll break yours down into simple, doable milestones. 
  - Not by mapping out every step of the next six months — but by setting the first few milestones you can aim for, then deciding what matters most this month and this week. 
  - You’ll learn how to stay flexible, adjust as you go, and keep moving without overplanning yourself into a corner.
- **How to build habits that stick.** 
  -  Forget motivation. It’s unreliable as hell.
  - No hype, no hacks. Just small, smart systems that make it easier to show up, even when you don’t feel like it.
- **How to stay on track when plans fall apart.** 
  - Because they will.  Plans fall apart. Motivation dies. 
  - You’ll leave with a simple review system to check progress, adjust fast, and keep moving forward without the drama.
  - **Progress over perfection. Always.**



**No fluff. No life-coach speak. Just what works.**



## **Who’s It For?**

Anyone tired of saying “this year will be different” and then falling into the same old loop.

Whether you’re aiming for a career breakthrough, rebuilding your fitness, fixing your finances, or focusing on personal growth — — this workshop helps you lock in what matters and start moving fast.

It’s for people who are ready to stop overthinking and start doing.

 Yes, there will be slides to support the session. But remember, this is a doing session, not a TED talk.

 One sharp, high-impact session. You'll walk out with a system, not a sales pitch for a follow-up course.

**What if I already have goals?**
 Good. We'll see if they still matter, if they're clear, and if you've got a way to follow through when motivation takes a nap. The workshop will help you refine them using our frameworks.

 Nope. Doesn't matter if you're leading a team, launching a business, training for an Ironman, or just tired of drifting. This is for anyone ready to move with purpose.

## Workshop Leaders

**Who are you, and why are you the right people for this?**
 We've lived this. Not just talked about it. We've built careers, businesses, bodies, and lives by getting clear, setting sharp goals, and sticking to systems when the motivation wore off. This is the stuff we use ourselves, and we're passing it on raw and real.

**Will I get support after the workshop?**
 The workshop is designed to give you a complete system you can implement independently. However, we'll provide resources you can reference afterward to help reinforce what you've learned.

**How is this different from other goal-setting workshops?**
 We focus on execution, not just inspiration. Many workshops leave you feeling good but without clear next steps. We prioritize practical applications, real-world examples, and creating systems that work even when willpower doesn't.
